<h2>✺ Hello my name is CAROLINA and I'm an artist based in LISBON ✺</h2>

<p>As a DESIGNER I’m focused on developing creative Digital Experiences through user centered methodologies.</p>

<p>This way, as a “Design motto”, I believe that the function of the designer in society goes through a careful and conscious vision of what surrounds us, a social commitment, responsible but also curious.</p>

<p>As an ARTIST and evolving human being I believe we are to live in the duality of comfort and discomfort, where the two polarities co-exist in the right balance.</p>

<p>Thank you so much for taking the time to get to know me.</p>

<p>“Art should Comfort the disturbed and disturb the comfortable”</p>
