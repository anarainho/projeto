<h1>SPOTIFY NEW FEATURES</h1>
<h2>Work developed on University</h2>

<h2>THE CHALLENGE</h2>
<p>Our goal was to design a new feature on an already existing global app, so we chose Spotify. It was intended for our featureto be intricate enough, while still sticking to the existing brand design system.</p>

<p>Sometimes designers work with companies with an established identity.</p> 
So how do they help them innovate?</p>

<p>By bringing new perspectives, ideas and, mainly, by creating new features for the product. Thus designers help brands stand out and keep up with what people want and need. We took a deeper look at Spotify and decided to spice it up.</p>

<h2>WHY SPOTIFY</h2>

<p>Spotify is the most popular music and podcast streaming platform in the world. It focuses on giving a simple and intuitive experience of listening and finding music.</p>

<p>Despite allowing users to follow their friends and see what they’re listening to, the platform has not developed much further in this social field, which we believe has a lot of potential.</p>

<p>To make this platform more social without forgetting its main goal implies thinking of this interaction between friends to be about sharing music.</p>
