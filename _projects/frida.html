<h1>FRIDA KHALO</h1>
<h2>Work developed on University</h2>

<h2>THE CHALLENGE</h2>
<p>The purpose of this project was to design an interface using the Design System created during the classes of Interface Design.

<p>That being said, we had to choose a physical product and design an online store – for desktop and mobile – that would only the selected product.</p>

<p>My choice was “Frida”, an illustrated book by Benjamin Lacombe (about some of the most relevant moments of Frida Kahlo’s life).
For the final product, we should present three pages: Homepage, Product Details and Checkout.</p>
